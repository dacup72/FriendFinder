### Friend Finder

Friend Finder is a front and back end application designed to compare saved survey scores in order to discover your best match for a friend.  The back end runs with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and uses [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) along with [Path.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path) for back end routing.  The database that stores user input from the survey is a simple javascript file expoerting an array of objects.  Have fun finding your match online!
